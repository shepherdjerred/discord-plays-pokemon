The window on the right shows the Discord application with a user named Pokebot in a voice channel. Discord is also displaying a text channel where users can enter commands to control the Pokémon bot](docs/docs/assets/images/screenshot_all.png)

This application allows your Discord server to play a cooperative game of Pokémon (or any other Gameboy Advanced ROM) using Discord as the input method. The concept is similar to that of [Twitch Plays Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon).

This project also includes a built-in web interface to allow direct control of the game without needing to type commands into Discord. Once the web page is loaded, key presses are sent directly to the emulator.

See [the documentation](https://discord-plays-pokemon.sjer.red/) for more information.
