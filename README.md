# Discord Plays Pokémon

<video src='https://github.com/shepherdjerred/discord-plays-pokemon/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/docs/assets/videos/demo.mp4' width=180></video>

This application allows your Discord server to play a cooperative game of Pokémon (or any other Game Boy Advance ROM) using Discord as the input method. The concept is similar to that of [Twitch Plays Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon).

This project also includes a built-in web interface to allow direct control of the game without needing to type commands into Discord. Once the web page is loaded, key presses are sent directly to the emulator.

See [the documentation](https://docs.discord-plays-pokemon.com/) for more information. View [the roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for information about upcoming features.
