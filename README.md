The window on the right shows the Discord application with a user named Pokebot in a voice channel. Discord is also displaying a text channel where users can enter commands to control the Pokémon bot](docs/docs/assets/images/screenshot_all.png)

This application allows your Discord server to play a cooperative game of Pokémon (or any other Gameboy Advanced ROM) using Discord as the input method. The concept is similar to that of [Twitch Plays Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon)

See [the documentation](https://discord-plays-pokemon.netlify.app/) for more information.
