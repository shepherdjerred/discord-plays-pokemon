# Discord Plays Pokémon

This application allows your Discord server to play a cooperative game of Pokémon (or any other Game Boy Advance ROM) using Discord as the input method. The concept is similar to that of [Twitch Plays Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon)

Follow the [tutorial](./user/index.md) to set up the bot.
