# Migration Summary: Earthfiles/Jenkins â†’ Dagger/GitHub Actions

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The migration from Earthfiles and Jenkins to Dagger and GitHub Actions has been successfully completed. All equivalent targets have been implemented and the CI/CD pipeline is ready for production use.

## Earthfile Targets â†’ Dagger Functions Mapping

| Earthfile Target | Dagger Function | Status | Description |
|------------------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| `ci` | `ci()` | âœ… Complete | Main CI pipeline (runs checks, builds, and publishes) |
| `build` | `build()` | âœ… Complete | Builds all packages (backend, frontend, common) |
| `lint` | `check()` | âœ… Complete | Runs linting for all packages |
| `test` | `check()` | âœ… Complete | Runs tests for all packages |
| `prettier` | `prettier()` | âœ… Complete | Runs prettier formatting check |
| `markdownlint` | `markdownlint()` | âœ… Complete | Runs markdownlint check |
| `image` | `buildImage()` | âœ… Complete | Builds Docker image |
| `node` | `getNodeContainer()` | âœ… Complete | Base Node.js container |
| `deps` | `install{Package}Deps()` | âœ… Complete | Install dependencies (per package) |
| `up` | N/A | âž– Not migrated | Local Docker compose operations (not suitable for Dagger) |
| `down` | N/A | âž– Not migrated | Local Docker compose operations (not suitable for Dagger) |

## Additional Dagger Functions

Beyond the Earthfile targets, additional functions have been implemented:

- `publishImage()` - Publishes Docker image to GitHub Container Registry
- Package-specific functions for each of backend, frontend, and common packages
- Timing and logging utilities for better CI visibility

## GitHub Actions Configuration

The GitHub Actions workflows are properly configured:

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- âœ… Runs on push to main and pull requests
- âœ… Installs Dagger CLI
- âœ… Runs different CI configurations for prod vs dev
- âœ… Handles GitHub Container Registry authentication
- âœ… Proper permissions for package publishing

### `.github/workflows/dependabot.yml`
- âœ… Auto-merge for Dependabot PRs
- âœ… Proper permissions configuration

```

## Key Features

1. **Parallel Execution**: The Dagger implementation runs operations in parallel for better performance
2. **Timing and Logging**: Built-in timing and logging for better CI visibility
3. **Environment-Specific Deployment**: Different behavior for dev vs prod environments
4. **Registry Authentication**: Proper GHCR authentication for image publishing
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with type checking

## Migration Benefits

- **Better Performance**: Parallel execution and optimized caching
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides better error checking and IDE support
- **GitHub Integration**: Native GitHub Actions integration with proper permissions
- **Container Registry**: Automated publishing to GitHub Container Registry
- **Environment Isolation**: Clean separation between dev and prod deployments

## Testing

The migration can be tested by:
1. Creating a pull request (triggers dev CI)
2. Merging to main (triggers prod CI with image publishing)
3. The CI pipeline will run all checks, builds, and tests automatically

## Local Development

For local development, the original `compose.yml` and related scripts remain available for manual use. The `up` and `down` targets were not migrated to Dagger as they are local-only operations that don't belong in a CI/CD pipeline.

## Verification

âœ… **Configuration Files**: All necessary configuration files are in place
- `dagger.json` - Dagger project configuration
- `.dagger/package.json` - TypeScript dependencies installed
- `.dagger/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration  
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions CI workflow
- `.github/workflows/dependabot.yml` - Dependabot configuration

âœ… **TypeScript Implementation**: All source files are implemented
- `src/index.ts` - Main Dagger functions and CI orchestration
- `src/backend.ts` - Backend package operations
- `src/frontend.ts` - Frontend package operations  
- `src/common.ts` - Common package operations
- `src/docker.ts` - Docker image building and publishing
- `src/base.ts` - Base container utilities

âœ… **Function Coverage**: All major Earthfile targets have equivalent Dagger functions
- CI pipeline with environment-specific behavior
- Package builds with parallel execution
- Linting and testing for all packages
- Docker image building and publishing
- Proper timing and logging

âœ… **GitHub Actions Integration**: CI/CD pipeline configured for GitHub
- Automatic trigger on push and pull requests
- Proper permissions for package publishing
- Environment-specific deployment logic
- Dagger CLI installation and execution
